  <description>Alters several vanilla animals to enable hauling. Made with the power of xpath patching so only the trainable intelligence and/or body size are affected without completely overriding each animal.
  If you want to have full control over the animals with the ability to haul, I recommend a manual install. Open the patch file in a text editor and delete the operations for the animals you don't want.</description>
